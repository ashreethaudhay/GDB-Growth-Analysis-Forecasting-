Introduction
 
This study develops a framework to forecast US GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth on a quarterly frequency from 1947 – 2022. Real exports of Goods and Services manipulated and released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis – based on concepts consistent with exports of real Gross Domestic Product — serve as an important tool for measuring the real value of export goods that is adjusted for the effects of price changes.
This time-series data on real exports of Goods and Services are released in the “Research Data” section on the FRED Economic Data website and widely used by those who follow the state of the financial economy  The models that we use here are based on real sector of the US economy, are forecasted, and estimated by using Holt’ Exponential Smoothing model, Damped Trend Exponential Smoothing model, Linear Regression model (Simple Linear Regression model), ARIMA model and more.
This study seeks to develop an appropriate forecasting model to predict US gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the next few years (5-8 years). We are well known that the economic forecasting of US has historically been in a critical fraught situation. The main objective of this paper is to design a framework that accurately observes and captures the performing and underlying economic structure of US and precise variables that provides information about the indicators.
We would construct a quarterly forecasting framework with given variables as the key variables, with based on economic theory on the real exports of goods and services. By using the different forecasting models, we would be arriving to a conclusion with best model fit by analyzing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) values generated by each model.
Thus, we would be predicting the values by considering the MAPE values of each model fit and will forecast the values for next set of years. We would choose the most effective forecasting model based on estimation of the forecasted values and evaluating the predictive ability of various multivariate models.
